# Cloudlog

This is a [Cloudlog](https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog) fork made to add
some features not supported by the upstream project, such as:

* Full Spanish translations
* [Citizens Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio) (11m)
* Whatever else needed in a future

If you want to use your self-hosted Cloudlog instance, it is **highly
recommended** that you use the [original
project](https://github.com/magicbug/Cloudlog) because this one **might be
de-synchronized or abandoned at any time**.

All changes that you want to propose, you shall do them to the original
project. If you find something interesting here, feel free to propose it to the
original project (mention is appreciated :wink: :wink:)
